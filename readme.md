The Platform team is tasked to provide infrastructure and guidance for a new initiative named RIO. The RIO project is tasked with building both internal and extern web services.

The project does not yet know the end state but have invited us to experiment to show what we can deliver within a week to support the initial architecture.

in this experiment we have chosen to use terraform for our IaC tool.
Any pipeline will be targeting GitHub actions for deployment.
The project will be created to use Azure as a public cloud platform.

The components selected might not be production grade ready inhouse yet, but we will build services that are within the company standard.

## Project folder structure

This experiment is structured in a single repository contain the whole setup. This structure might deviate from the structure needed for the final solution as multiple teams and responsibilities most likely will be involved at a later state.

All application code for the experiment is contained in subfolders under the [**components**](./components) folder.

All terraform code is contained under in the [**terraform**](./terraform) folder.
The different stacks are contained in seperate sub folders. This is done to support the devops flow and preserve the sanity of the team members experimenting together.

In the [**terraform/stacks**](./terraform/stacks/) folder all the configurations for the core, frontend and backend stacks are sorted in subfolders. This makes it simpler to create pipelines to support the testing and deployment of the stacks. In other scenarios this structure might use seperate repositories.

Any terraform modules created to support multiple stacks are created in subfolders within the [**terraform/modules**](./terraform/modules/) folder. The modules path is identified with the path '../../modules/module-name/' in the stacks.

Any pipelines for GitHub are stored under [**.github/workflows**](./.github/workflows/) and named after the stack they are set up to use.

### Core

TODO document core components

The project weill deploy all components within a single subscription in Azure.
each stack will exist within it's own resource group where it makes sense. We will use a simplified naming convention for the experiment and thereby deviating from the company standard. This is approved by the architects.

At the core of this setup we will use Azure Container Apps operating inside an internal *Azure Container Apps Environment*. This environment is linked to a Azure Virtual Network that is operated by the team. This will allow the use of native Network security mechanizm like NSG to enforce inbout and outbound rules.

## Setup

> This chapter will describe all the steps needed to deploy the experiment

All initial deployments are done from a local developer machine.
Terraform is configured to use remote storage. The storage provider for this project is Azure Storage Account.
In a production setup, this would be part of the landignzone post setup jobs.
Running on a local development setup the needed steps are recorded in the [deploy-core.ps1](./terraform/scripts/deploy-core-ps1) script. This script will create a new storage account for the terraform state file.

## Test

> This chapter will describe the testing setup enabled in this experiment

No testing have been enabled at this point.
We have an idea of enabeling test suites for our common terraform modules, for our data inputs and for the application code that will be executed on top of this infrastructure.

Any external referenced endpoints can be added to data used by PowerShell Pester framework.
The same framework can be used to testing and verifying both the statefile used by each pipeline and to validate resources in Azure directly. The statefile can be exported to a json format that makes this process easier using PowerShell.

Other test are to built into the pipelines themselves and triggered by the pull requests and or commits.
